# ADDA-Individual Practices

Proposed solutions for the Individual Practices from Data-Analysis and Algorithms-Design ADDA course at [Universidad de Sevilla](https://www.us.es/)

These exercises measure your skills when working with different kinds of algorithms for problem solving. Such algorithms include Linear Programming, Genetic Algorithms and the use of Virtual Graphs. All the files uploaded here have been tested and function properly, providing a working solution, though not necessarily the most optimal one in the case of some Genetic Algorithms.


To work with recursive data types, graphs, linear programming, etc, I make use of the repository adda_v4, developed by [Miguel Toro Bonilla](https://github.com/migueltoro).

Acknowledgment to [amoraschi](https://github.com/amoraschi) and [RodriguezLaraRafa](https://github.com/RodriguezLaraRafa), this wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for their help.
